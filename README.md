- **Classical Baselines**: Round Robin, Proportional Fair, Water-Filling, Convex Optimization
- **ML Prediction Models**: LSTM and Transformer-based predictors for channel/traffic forecasting
- **Hybrid Algorithms**: ML-augmented optimization that uses predictions to warm-start solvers
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multi-scenario simulation framework with detailed performance metrics

## Algorithm Comparison

### Classical Baselines
1. **Round Robin (RR)**: Equal resource distribution
2. **Proportional Fair (PF)**: Balances throughput and fairness
3. **Water-Filling**: Optimal power allocation with greedy RB assignment
4. **Convex Optimization**: CVXPY-based optimal allocation

### ML-Augmented Methods
1. **ML-Guided Proportional Fair**: Uses traffic predictions to adjust fairness parameters
2. **ML-Augmented Convex**: Incorporates predictions into optimization constraints with warm starting

### Hybrid Framework Benefits
- **Prediction-Informed Allocation**: Uses LSTM/Transformer forecasts of channel gains and traffic demands
- **Warm Starting**: ML predictions initialize optimization variables for faster convergence
- **Adaptive Confidence**: System adapts to prediction quality and falls back to classical methods when needed
- **Energy Efficiency**: Proactive allocation reduces power consumption
